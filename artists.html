                    Josh K-I-Double-D is the the newst member of the Labrat collective and has been
                    plotting to explode onto the Irish hiphop landscape with the release of his long awaited
                    mixtape 'KIDDOLOGY'. This project features resident beat maker Cian Arthur on production
                    and a handful of different Labrats lending vocals to version tracks on the mixtape.
                    The release will mark KIDDs first ever release as an up and coming artist and is sure
                    to send tremors through the country. There is rumours of a second mixtape that has yet to be
                    named, but is sure to capture the same energy KIDD emits on Kiddology as he pushes himself
                    to prove his writing, flow and delivery with every track he pens.
