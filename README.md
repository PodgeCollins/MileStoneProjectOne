# UX User Experience:

## User stories:

### First Time Visitor Goals
 -As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and
 learn more about the organisation.

 -As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

 -As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of 
 them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their 
 followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

### Returning Visitor Goals
 -As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about coding challenges.

 -As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with 
 the organisation with any questions I may have.

 -As a Returning Visitor, I want to find community links.

### Frequent User Goals
 -As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added 
 challenges or hackathons.

 -As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

 -As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed 
 any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.

## Design:

### Colour Scheme
 -The main colours used are Purple for the text, icons & clicking text boxes, 
 a light pink for hovering over navbar and icons and bluish white hue to the background.

### Typography
 -The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif 
 as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the 
 site correctly. Roboto is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both 
 aesthically appealing and appropriate.

### Imagery
 -The imagery was important as I need to show the collectives Logo, the artists themselves
 and merchandise they wished to sell on the website. I feel the collectives artwork
 is original and gets across the energy the collective emit

# Testing 

## Furthur Testing

-The Website was tested on Google Chrome & Safari 

-It was viewed on a variety of devices such a Laptop, Iphone 11, Ipad and Oneplus5

-A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

-My brother was asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or 
user experience issues.

## Known Bugs

-The hero image would bounce down before allowing the navbar to scroll by and fix position.
To correct this I added a ToggleClass of extra padding to the Jquery to stop this from happening.

-The same bouncing issue became to happen when the website would respond with small screens.
To correct this I wrote a media query to cancel out the extra padding on screen sizes smaller
than 992px.
